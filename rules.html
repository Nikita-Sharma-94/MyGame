<h2><b><font color="teal">Reverse it : Basic rules</font></b><h2>
<h4>Each reverse it piece has a red side and a blue side. On your turn, you place one piece on the board with your color facing up. You must place the piece so that an opponent's piece, or a row of opponent's pieces, is flanked by your pieces. All of the opponent's pieces between your pieces are then turned over to become your color.</h4> 
<h2><b><font color="teal">Aim of the game</font></b><h2>
<h4>The object of the game is to own more pieces than your opponent when the game is over. The game is over when neither player has a move. Usually, this means the board is full.</h4> 
<h2><b><font color="teal">Start of the game</font></b><h2> 
<h4>The game starts with 2 red pieces and 2 blue pieces arranged at the center of the reverse it board, consisting of 64 squares in an 8x8 grid, such that pieces of similar color are diagonal to each other and pieces of similar color are vertically/horizontally next to each other.</h4> 
<h2><b><font color="teal">Playing the game</font></b><h2> 
<h4>A move consists of placing one piece on an empty square such that an opponent's piece, or a row of opponent's pieces, is flanked by your pieces. All of the opponent's pieces between your pieces are then turned over to become your color.</h4>	
<h2><b><font color="teal">End of the game</font></b><h2>  
<h4>When no player can move, the player with her/his color dominant on the board wins!</h4>
